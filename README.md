# cardiac-cycle-tracking

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) account for more than 26% of national mortality rates in the UK. Many CVDs can be diagnosed early by assessing heart abnormalities. Therefore, it is necessary to develop accurate tools for a timely intervention. This project aims to construct a working prototype of a heart cardiac cycle tracking system using CINE Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). The proposed approach combines two models, a pretrained U-net model using VGG16 as its backbone for myocardium organ segmentation and a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory model (CNN-LSTM) for future frame generation. The system is trained to receive heart MRI images as input, perform a segmentation task on the myocardium muscle, and then employ those segmented frames to generate future frames of the muscle using the CNN-LSTM model. The models were evaluated on the ACDC-MICCAI 2017 dataset with the segmentation model having a dice coefficient of 0.79 highlighting its ability to successfully perform segmentation of muscles on MRI images and the frame generation model having a structural similarity index (SSIM) score of 0.94 demonstrating its competence to generate accurate future frames.
